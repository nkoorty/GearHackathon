# GearHack

## Description
Gearhead is an iOS-based game that seamlessly integrates the Polkadot.js wallet of a user and allows uses the freemium Gear model to train, level up, and sell dynamic NFTs, also called Monsters or Pets. The problem that it solves is the bottleneck of Web-based games and integrating Web3 onto iOS devices in no time. Through a battle mechanic, which in the future going to use gas reservations to decide on a particular game strategy, decides the outcome of a game and based on the outcome, your Monster gains XP which allows it to dynamically change. Once a Monster gains XP, it becomes more valuable, and hence can be resold in a marketplace.
## Submission Requirements
### 1. 
The gNFT smart contract was adapated towards the idea of the Monsters/Characters in the game having dynamic attributes. Changes to the samples were made in order to accommodate the particular data that is being request by the iOS frontend.
### 2. 
Gtest details are added ASAP.
### 3.
Frontend is built using Swift (UIKit, and SpriteKit). Pictures will be attached ASAP. 
### 4. 
Frontend interacts with Backend using HTTP requests, which are managed by an Express.js Server and a NetworkManager.
